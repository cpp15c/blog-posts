Dogs are known and loved as man’s best friend, however, their wild cousins are another story. One night, a wolf made its way into town from the desert,
coming into contact with an unlucky man who was minding his own business walking down the street. This man sure would not be too fond of dogs or the sort
if he found out his death was owed to the deceivingly weak beast. The gentleman was “terribly mauled” by the wolf shortly after their meeting. Not only was
this man killed, but four men and a boy attempted to come to his rescue, to no avail. All five subjects were injured by the wolf and had to be hospitalized
due to the severity of their wounds. The crazed animal was depicted to be “suffering from hydrophobia,” possibly from spending countless days victim to the
desert sun and sand. The matter was laid to rest when the wolf was captured and shot by the police.
