I have had the worst luck with scanning the microfilm. The first time I went, I scanned as normal, one page at a time. This
resulted in a majority of my text being unreadable by the OCR. I could not get a crisp image no matter how much I adjusted
the brightness, contrast, and sharpness. Sadly, most of the edges of my pages for my week were faded on the left hand side
as well, making it even more difficult to get a decent scan. After a bit of work, I decided to just put in the extra work
and do four individual scans per page, adjusting the brightness for each one, and stitch them together using the Image
Composite Editor. This solved my two main issues of clarity and ability to see the edge. This was extremely time consuming.
I had six days each of which with six pages (besides two that had eight). Doing the math here, four images times six pages
is twenty four scans per issue. Multiply this by four for the four issues that have six pages, and that’s ninety six. Four
images times eight pages is thirty two. This number is multiplied by two for the two days that had eight pages, which is
sixty four. That’s a grand total of one hundred and sixty individual scans. I hope to never have to do this again.
